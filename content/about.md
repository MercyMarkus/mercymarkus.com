I am a civil engineering graduate who got perplexed by how manual and repetitive the construction industry was. I made a switch and started learning about data science and machine learning in 2018 whilst leveraging cloud technologies along the way.

Previously, I've worked as a Data Scientist for at Carbon, a Fintech company and now work as a Software Engineer on Microsoft's Mixed Reality Team.

I'll primarily write about technologies I'm learning about and use mini-projects to consolidate this knowledge.
