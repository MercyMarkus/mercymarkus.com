A friend and colleague recommended _Designing Data-Intensive Applications_ (DDIA) to me back in 2022. He found it invaluable while building and maintaining systems that needed to be highly available and reliable. Although I attempted to start the book several times, I never made it past the first chapter. Over the weekend, however, I finally committed to diving in and sticking with it.

## Why I Picked It Up Again

I spent most of 2024 on a sabbatical, reflecting on where to focus my energies upon returning to active development. During this time, I explored Systems Engineering, delving into the Linux Kernel and experimenting with the Rust programming language. While fascinating, it was also overwhelming. The steep learning curve left me feeling impatient and unsure of my direction.

Conversations with a friend who works as a Data Engineer reminded me of my initial plan to transition to data engineering in late 2020. That plan had been set aside when I pivoted to an exciting Software Engineering role at Microsoft. Revisiting DDIA and the Data Engineering path felt like a natural step, given my background in data science and experience as a software engineer.

This time, my goal is to approach the book with patience and consistency. I plan to read about 100 pages weekly and document my key takeaways here. Let’s see how far I get!

### Notes on Chapter 1

Chapter 1 provides a gentle introduction to reasoning about data-intensive applications. Martin Kleppmann explains what makes an application data-intensive rather than compute-intensive and outlines three primary concerns of most software systems: reliability, scalability, and maintainability. Here’s what stood out to me:

1. Reliability: Applications should function as intended most of the time. Faults are inevitable, but they should be anticipated and handled gracefully. The key question is: Failures are inevitable but how do you bounce back and ensure minimal disruption?

1. Scalability: Scalability ensures that an application can handle increased load effectively. A critical insight from this chapter was the importance of identifying the right load parameters for your application. For example, in an e-commerce store, tracking the response time of attempted or completed checkouts might be more meaningful than monitoring the number of site visits.

This section also highlighted that all measurements are inherently inaccurate to some degree, as the tools used for monitoring are based on estimations. The takeaway is to focus on the right metrics that help inform scaling decisions.

1. Maintainability: Building a reliable and scalable system is just the beginning. Maintainability ensures that the system remains operable, efficient, and developer-friendly over time. Poorly maintained systems can frustrate the engineers working on them, leading to burnout or high turnover. The goal is to design systems that are straightforward to troubleshoot, update, and extend.

## Final Thoughts

DDIA has often been referred to as the "holy grail" for designing and understanding data-intensive systems. Chapter 1 alone has provided valuable insights, and I’m excited to continue this journey. My plan is to take it one step at a time and document my learnings as I progress.
