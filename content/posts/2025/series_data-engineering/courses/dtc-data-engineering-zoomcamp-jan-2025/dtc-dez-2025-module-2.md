This module covers workflow orchestration using [Kestra](https://go.kestra.io/de-zoomcamp/github).

Kestra is an open-source, event-driven orchestration platform that simplifies building both scheduled and event-driven workflows. By adopting Infrastructure as Code practices for data and process orchestration, Kestra enables you to build reliable workflows with just a few lines of YAML.
