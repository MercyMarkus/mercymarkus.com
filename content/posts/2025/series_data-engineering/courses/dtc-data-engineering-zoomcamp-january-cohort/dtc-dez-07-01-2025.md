After hours of bumbling about, I finally figured out the structure of the self paced course which is that follow along videos are hosted on DTC's youtube page and the notes on GitHub are supplementary and not the source of truth.

## [DE Zoomcamp 1.2.1 - Introduction to Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYNwNlOrpr0&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=4) Commands

| Description    | Command |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Run the Ubuntu container and initialize the Bash Shell. (`-it` means it opens a terminal with an interactive shell when running the Ubuntu container) | `sudo docker run -it ubuntu bash`    |
| Run the python v3.9 container  | `sudo docker run -it python:3.9`    |
| Run the python container with a bash entrypoint so you can install pandas onto the container  | `sudo docker run -it --entrypoint=bash python:3.9`    |
| Build the [Dockerfile](add-link) from the pwd. Said file uses the Python 3.9 image, installs Pandas using pip and sets Bash as the entry point of the container. | `sudo docker build -t test:pandas .` (test is the image name) |
| Run container built from the Dockerfile | `sudo docker run -it test:pandas` |
| After updating the Dockerfile's entrypoint to `[ "python" , "pipeline.py"]`, you can pass the python file the date arg directly when running the container | `sudo docker run -it test:pandas 2023-05-08` |
