Coming from a Python background, switching to C# was daunting. The syntax was more verbose, with more filler code. Setting up projects was also more involved in comparison to Python.

Overtime, I've come to appreciate and even understand the language better.
I'm starting this series (and hopefully more üòÖü§ûüèæ) as a way to document and share my learnings. It started as an attempt to share a new thing I'd learned and grew into an attempt at building something I'd find useful.

I settled with building a CLI tool aggregator that allows me customize my favorite CLI commands. One of things I was most curious about was building a database of my internet speeds over time.

From here on out, I'll be referring to the CLI tool we'll be building as **"Commander"** and using it from the CLI by typing **cmdr** (I'm shortening this for convenience sake).

_**Early disclaimer: Months into writing/building this I discovered that speedtest.net does most of what I wanted commander to do (save for detecting my connection type). Figured folks trying to build a dotnet tool might still find this useful.**_

{{< toc >}}

### What I'd like Commander to do

1. Run my favorite CLI commands using command verbs of my choosing. e.g instead of **`git pull`**, I can run **`cmdr gp`** instead.
2. Save the output of the CLI command I'm most interested in (**`speed-test`**) as a JSON file on my computer.
3. Add extra fields to this JSON output (**`dateTime`** and **`connectionType`**). I'd like to know the exact time I ran the command and if my internet connection was wired (ethernet cable) or wireless (WiFi).
4. Upload every run of this command to a cloud database. I'd probably do something uncomplicated like updating an online spreadsheet.
5. Build a live dashboard with the data.

I'll be building my first objective using C#. The end result is a console application that can be packaged and installed as a NuGet Package. To make this less verbose, I'll assume this is not your first time using C# or the .NET CLI. If this is, please check out official documentation on how to setup your development environment if you'd like to follow along:

- [Set up your development environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/local-environment)

> Note: For this project, I'm using Visual Studio 2022 with C# 10 which was a part of the .NET 6 release. [Read more on C# 10](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/welcome-to-csharp-10/).

### Creating a hello world .NET tool {#create-hello-world-dotnet-tool}

**What is a .NET tool?**

> The .NET CLI lets you create a console application as a tool, which others can install and run. DotNet tools are NuGet packages that are installed from the .NET CLI. For more information about tools, check out the [.NET tools overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools).

I'll be creating different checkpoints for the development of commander. The first is a hello world .NET tool that uses the **`System.CommandLine`** package to handle our CLI "inputs". These inputs are called _arguments_. We'll talk more about this in the next post.

We'll be able to give the tool an input (a name) and then it says hello back. This checkpoint is inspired by [this dotnet walkthrough ](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api/blob/main/docs/Your-first-app-with-System-CommandLine.md).

Here, I'm using the .NET CLI command line tool to setup a console application.

```Shell
dotnet new console -o commander
cd commander
dotnet add package System.CommandLine --prerelease
```

- The **`dotnet new`** keyword sets up a sample console application.
- The **`dotnet add`** keyword adds the **System.CommandLine** package to our project. The package is still in _Beta_ hence the **`prerelease`** flag.

After running the commands above, you'll have a simple application that prints out **`Hello, World!`** when you run the application.

### Building out Commander: [First checkpoint](https://github.com/MercyMarkus/commander/tree/check-point-1)

This involves:

1. Making our project packable a.k.a the output of our project should be a NuGet package.
2. Install this package globally on our computer i.e running **`cmdr`** should print out **`Hello, World`**.
3. Use System.CommandLine to accept a name (**`--name`**) as input so we can print **`Hello, Mercy!`** if the `--name` input is included in the command.

**For the first step our `Commander.csproj` file needs to look like this:**

```C#
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
    <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
        <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
        <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
        <PackAsTool>true</PackAsTool>
        <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>
        <ToolCommandName>cmdr</ToolCommandName>
        <PackageId>Commander</PackageId>
        <Description>Commander is a CLI tool aggregator that allows me customize my favorite CLI commands.</Description>
        <Authors>Mercy Markus</Authors>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="System.CommandLine" Version="2.0.0-beta3.22114.1" />
    </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

From the official definitions:

- **PackAsTool** indicates if the NuGet package should be configured as a .NET tool suitable for use with **`dotnet tool install`** (this is the command for installing .NET tools). It's what we are most interested in here.
- **GeneratePackageOnBuild** is for convenience sake. I'd like a new `.nupkg` (NuGet Package) to be generated every time I build the project. The alternative is running the **`nuget pack`** command manually every time.
- **ToolCommandName** specifies the command that'll invoke the tool after it's installed.
- **PackageId** is a case-insensitive NuGet package identifier, which must be unique across nuget.org or whatever gallery the NuGet package will reside in. IDs may not contain spaces or characters that are not valid for a URL, and generally follow .NET namespace rules. This is important when we're publishing our NuGet package to a gallery so it can be easily discovered and used.
- **Description** is a long description of the NuGet package for UI display.

**For the second step:**

The tool can be installed globally with:

```Shell
dotnet tool install --global --add-source ./bin/Debug Commander --version 1.0.0
```

By default, NuGet attempts to find the package in package sources we've already added to the NuGet Package Manager. The `--add-source` flag's value points to the location of the NuGet package that gets generated when we build the project.

The output of running this is:

```Shell
You can invoke the tool using the following command: cmdr
Tool 'commander' (version '1.0.0') was successfully installed.
```

Because we installed the tool globally, running `cmdr` from any terminal window will print `Hello, World!`.

More information can be found here: [How to manage .NET tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools#install-a-global-tool).

**For the third step, we'd like to accept a `name` input**

Our `Program.cs` file now looks like this:

```Program.cs
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
using System.CommandLine;

// Create name option:
var nameOption = new Option<string>(
    new[] { "--name", "-n" },
    description: "A 'name' option whose argument is a string representing a name.");

nameOption.IsRequired = true;
nameOption.SetDefaultValue("World");

var rootCommand = new RootCommand()
{
    nameOption
};

rootCommand.Description = "A Hello Greeter App";

rootCommand.SetHandler((string name) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"The value for --name is: {name}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}!");
}, nameOption);

// Parse the incoming argument and invoke the handler
return rootCommand.Invoke(args);
```

The following are happening:

1. We're using System.CommandLine to create an option (**`--name`**) that'll be used to accept a `name` input. This option is also required when the parent command is invoked.
   > Note: When an option is required and the parent command (`cmdr`) is invoked without it, an error occurs. This won't happen here because we're setting a default value for name.
2. Setting the default value **`SetDefaultValue`** = **`World`** to maintain the out-of-box experience we got when we [started building out commander](#building-out-commander).
3. Making the root command aware of the `nameOption`. You can think of an option as a symbol defining a named parameter that'll hold a value for that parameter.
4. Adding a description for the root command.
5. Passing the `name` input we're getting from the command line to the root command's handler when we invoke the `cmdr` command.

We can update our tool to this new version by running:

```Shell
dotnet tool update --global --add-source ./bin/Debug Commander
```

Running `cmdr` results in:

```Shell
The value for --name is: World
Hello, World!
```

Running `cmdr --name "Mercy Markus"` results in:

```Shell
The value for --name is: Mercy Markus
Hello, Mercy Markus!
```

**Dotnet tools also come with help options out of the box.**

Running `cmdr --help` results in:

```Shell
Description:
  A Hello Greeter App

Usage:
  commander [options]

Options:
  -n, --name <name> (REQUIRED)  A 'name' option whose argument is a string representing a name. [default: World]
  --version                     Show version information
  -?, -h, --help                Show help and usage information
```

In the next post, we'll modify **commander** to include a speed check subcommand i.e `cmdr speed` outputs our network speed.
